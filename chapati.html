                    <li>Using a roller stick, make a ball circular and of desired size.</li>
                    <li>Place the circular dough on a pre-heated pan. Allow it to dry and turn it on its other side. Add oil on the side on the pan and gently rotate as you wait for it to turn golden brown. Do the same on the other side. </li>
                    <li>Repeat the same process for all the dough, and there you have your Chapati's.</li>
